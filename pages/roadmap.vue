This project will unify the announcement handler and block miner so that they smoothly share threads and the announcement handler takes priority, rewrite the the pool master in Rust and make it accept new announcement handlers registering (and unregistering) themselves, and make the announcement handler support proxying announcement requests for another handler in order to support operation over multiple networks."
