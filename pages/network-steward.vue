See the Network Steward Vote for more information about the mechanics of the vote. The payments to the network steward address have one special rule, they cannot be spent after 129600 blocks (approximately 3 months) have elapsed, so if the network steward cannot decide how to spend its treasury, the PKT will be burned rather than piling up."
